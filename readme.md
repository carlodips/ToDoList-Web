## ToDoList-Web
Hi I'm Carlo. I made this simple practice web app project called ToDoList-Web.

- ToDoList-web lets users add tasks and can be sorted by list. The user can set the due date for the task and the user can also edit and delete a task. Existing lists such as Default, Personal, Work, Wish List are available and also the user can add a new list and set its name. 

- This is just a simple app and it is only for practice purpose to hone my programming skills.
